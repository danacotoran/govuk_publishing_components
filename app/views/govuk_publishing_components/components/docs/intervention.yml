name: Intervention
description: An area that contains personalised content to the user
body: |
  The intervention is used to show personalised content. For instance, if the user has visited multiple
  pages in the same area of the site, we might want let them know that there are other pages on GOV.UK
  that would be useful to them. This component would be used to add this personalised content and would
  indicate to the user that this is not normally part of the page, but has been added for them specifically.

  The dismiss link points to the current URL with the "hide-intervention" query string parameter set to "true". The backend should check for this string in order to render the same page without the intervention.

  - have a border colour contrast ratio of more than 4.5:1 with its background to be visually distinct
  - prevent screen readers from announcing the dismiss link icon

examples:
  default:
    data:
      suggestion_text: You should renew your permit every 6 months.

  with_suggestion_link:

      suggestion_link_text: "Travel abroad: step by step"
      suggestion_link_url: /travel-abroad

      suggestion_link_url: /permit

  with_hide:
    description: |
      This example is for when we want to hide by default and display to the user based on some logic,
      either in the backend or with Javascript.
    data:
      suggestion_text: You should renew your permit every 6 months.
      suggestion_link_text: You may be invited to fill in a questionnaire
      suggestion_link_url: /questionnaire
      hide: true

  open_suggestion_link_in_new_tab:
    description: |
      When sending users to another online task, you don't want to completely hijack
      their original flow on GOV.UK. Adding the option to open links in a new tab helps to address this.
      Link text should tell the user that the link opens in a new tab.
      Note: "(opens in a new tab)" is added to link text if the phrase isn't included.
    data:
      suggestion_text: You should renew your permit every 6 months.
      suggestion_link_text: You can now apply for a permit online
      suggestion_link_url: www.google.com/permit
      new_tab: true

  with_data_attributes:
    description: |
      This example shows the use of `suggestion_data_attributes` and
      `dismiss_data_attributes` for click tracking.

      Other data attributes can also be applied as required. Note that the component does not include built in tracking. If this is required consider using the [track click script](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/blob/main/docs/analytics/track-click.md).
    data:
      suggestion_text: Based on your browsing you might be interested in
      suggestion_link_text: "Travel abroad: step by step"
      suggestion_link_url: /travel-abroad
      suggestion_data_attributes:
        track-category: interventionBanner
        track-action: interventionClicked
        track-dimension: "Travel abroad: step by step"
        track-dimension-index: 29
        track-label: clicked suggestion
      dismiss_text: Hide this suggestion
      dismiss_data_attributes:
        track-category: interventionBanner
        track-action: interventionDismissed
